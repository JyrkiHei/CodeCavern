I tried to create my Terraform CDKTF IaC pipelines using Github actions, but was greeted with an error when fetching providers and modules.
<!--more-->

The action steps I was doing were really basic. Just setting up Terraform CLI and running CDKTF-CLI (In previous step I had run 'npm install' already).

``` yaml
# Github action steps

- name: HashiCorp - Setup Terraform
  uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v1

- name: CDKTF - Load modules and providers
  run: cdktf get
```

And I was greeted with this lovely message!

``` yaml

Unexpected token c in JSON at position 1

```

I spent too much time diagnosing this one and Bing searches did not help (nor did google searches!). After I managed to guess some good search words from JSON parsing and Terraform I found this [issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-cdk/issues/1013) in Github.

So after some facepalming and a quick hour-long coffee break I changed my steps like this.

``` yaml
# Github action steps

- name: HashiCorp - Setup Terraform
  uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v1
  with:
    terraform_wrapper: false # Default: true
    # Breaks the build! 
    # https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-cdk/issues/1013

- name: CDKTF - Load modules and providers
  run: cdktf get
```

After that everything worked! Well, everything expect the "new" OIDC authentication to Azure, but that's another story
