Lately I've been wondering why AzCli sometimes shows subscriptions that I'm not logged into and was "worried" that I could accidentaly run commands to a wrong subscription... Like delete customers resourcegroups or something like that ðŸ¤•

### Today I learned that
AzCli caches many things and you can clear it if you really want...

```
az logout
az account clear
az login
```

"Problem" solved!
