Hi and welcome to my blog!

CodeCavern is a blog that I started writing about 10-12 years ago, but for some reason it was left to be forgotten in the depths of internet. My most "popular" post was about installing drivers for Nokia N900 in Windows Server OS so that gives an idea of the era :laughing:

I'm a father of two boys (3 & 6), trying to take care of the household and myself and naturally my wife. In the meantime I work as a software engineer/consultant at a company called [CGI](https://www.cgi.com) and try to come up with nice and cost effective solutions for my customers.

I've always been a Microsoft guy and started my career as a sharepoint developer. After doing that for almost 10 years I skipped train and join our RPA (Robotics Process Automation) team. Couple of years doing that finally lead me to my "true passion", cloud native development and operations.

During all of this, I have studied Azure as much as possible and hopefully now I can do Azure projects mainly in my everyday work.

My current interests are ~~everywhere~~ in ideas around DevOps or Insfrastructure-as-a-code. I really like to try script out everything usually with Az CLI or now with Bicep (For some reason, I've stayed clear of ARM before... go figure)

When I have some freetime I'm trying to write up the final work for my Master's Degree Programme at LAB University of Applied Sciences in Lahti. My final work is based on the concept of the next level of NoOps, AiOps :+1:

Please contact me at my [personal email](mailto:{{site.author.email}}) or send a message in LinkedIn (link at the bottom of the page). Hopefully you can find something intresting here!
